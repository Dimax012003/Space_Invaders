This is a space invaders game i made with python that uses pyserial in order to read the coordinates of two joysticks.One is used to move the object and the other one to set its direction.
I used an arduino mega2560 in order to read the data and send to the serial port.The python program reads this data with pyserial and uses them for the reasons o described above.I use Turtle graphics that 
sets the bullets,the backround,the spacecraft and the scoreboard
